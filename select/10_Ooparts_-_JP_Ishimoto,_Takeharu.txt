(Give me a chance, Dig me deep
Give me a chance, Dig me deep
Give me a chance, Dig me deep
Trust me with your words)

Give me a chance, Dig me deep
Waido na bijon de wairudo na yume wo
Atarashii mono, sore dake de Mono
Chouhou saseru yo

Gimikku ja nai, giri demo nai
Address me with your words
Mita me ja naku, miru me desho?
I always dress in rags

Kachikachi no kachikan You never can move
Chikachika hikaru machi Keep on it's move
Sukima sangyou, asa made zangyou What color was my soul?

Infinity, Dignity
Torakku no torappu ni don hamari, torippu
Same old face, say bye to old phase
Put your hands up and do the PEACE

Mujitsu, mumei, mushuu no onkei
Wakatte dattara All OK
Ooparts, cold heart, so dark tho 'find the mark

Get on your mark, karuchaa wa tubing, fuwafuwa to floating
Wataru itsumono sukuranburu, souitsu datte Ramble

Kyou no Keyword kiki nige shitan nara
Head set, get set, 'n get ready
Ooparts, cold heart, so dark, tho 'find the mark

Kasanaru yo, iro wo kae
Tell me who you are? What is in your mind?
Effect has defects. You are lost again
Step aside and see the world

Greedy mind. You know it in your mind
Yukusaki fuan?
Show me your smile, that's what they like
Kore miyo gashi

(It's) just a matter of time kirari hikaru aizu
It's a matter of fact okinimesu mama
Voracity, curiosity mita me ja naku, miru me deshou?

Risei ushinau, Ware miushinau
You're getting out of control
Itai kurai, sashikomu hikari
Zendaimimon, nishiki no doriimu

Just like a charm. No doubt, no harm
Wabisabi kikasete All OK
Ooparts, cold heart, so dark, tho 'find the mark

Madamada koko kara, satadenaito, chiekku, auto. zaDJ
Reality is full of immorality, say cheers to your ally baby

Give me a chance, Dig me deep
Waido na bijon de wairudo na yume wo
Atarashii mono, sore dake de Mono

Anonymity is annoying me
Jirenma ni wa shotto de shoubu
Ooparts, cold heart, so dark, tho' find the mark
